        The error message "Can only concatenate str (not 'dict') to str" occurs when you try to concatenate a dictionary (dict object) to a string

    while running "Test2"
    The error message "TypeError: string indices must be integers" occurs when you try to use a string as an index to access elements in a data structure, like a list or a dictionary.
     However, string indices must be integers because strings themselves are not directly indexable using other strings.
